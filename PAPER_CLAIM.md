# What we can claim, and what it takes to publish it

**Honest assessment, written from the measured results in
[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md).** Every number here is in a CSV on
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shanmuk4622/msc-cifar100).

Two papers are available. **Paper A is close.** Paper B needs one more
experiment. The gap analysis at the end is the part worth acting on.

## PAPER A — the main claim

> ### Oracle upper bounds for early-exit inference exceed the accuracy of the network they bound, and the excess grows as the exits improve.

> **UPDATED 2026-08-20 — the scale objection is CLOSED.** Study 4 P2 measured
> the excess at **224 px on ImageNet-100**: `resnet50` **+7.39 pt**,
> `vit_small_p16` **+6.91 pt**. It holds on a **vision transformer**, at a
> magnitude close to CIFAR-100's +6.86. The claim is no longer "on small
> convolutional networks at 32 px" and the title should not say so.
>
> Study 4 P0 adds bootstrap intervals on the CIFAR joint runs — 10.64
> [10.00, 11.28], 8.55 [7.98, 9.10], 9.15 [8.61, 9.71] — **3 of 3 excluding
> zero**, widths ~1.2 pt against effects of 8–11 pt.
>
> **AND A QUALIFICATION THAT MUST LEAD, NOT HIDE.** Study 4 P1 swept the honest
> (cross-seed) ceiling across budgets. **It changes sign at ρ ≈ 0.65:**
>
> | ρ | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.90 | 0.95 |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | honest headroom (pt) | **+7.74** | **+7.29** | **+3.74** | −3.05 | −8.30 | −13.13 | −14.98 |

### The one-paragraph version

Early-exit papers motivate adaptive inference by reporting an oracle bound: the
accuracy obtainable if each sample exited at the ideal layer. That oracle is
computed from the network being routed. We show it **exceeds that network's own
full-compute accuracy** — by 6.9 points on CIFAR-100, in 100 % of 90 runs — and
that the excess is exactly the fraction of samples some early exit gets right
while the final layer gets them wrong. Counter-intuitively the excess **grows**
when exits are trained jointly rather than post-hoc (8.6–10.6 pt), because
rescuing a sample the final layer fails requires a *competent* early exit. Using
a second training seed as an instrument, we show the excess does not survive a
change of seed (optimism bias +22.4 pt), and that a learned per-exit gate reading
the deployable signal recovers **1.7 %** of it at ρ = 0.80. **The picture is
budget-dependent**: sweeping ρ = 0.40–0.95, the honest cross-seed ceiling is
negative above ρ ≈ 0.65 but **positive below it** (+7.7 pt at ρ = 0.40), with
three independent exit rules agreeing within 1.8 points. So the *excess over
full compute* is unreachable by construction, while genuine seed-transferable
headroom does exist in the aggressive-budget regime that confidence
thresholding fails to capture.

### Why this is a real contribution, not a straw man

The target is named and current. A survey defines the oracle as *"the shallowest
internal classifier that provides a correct label prediction"* — precisely what
we implement. DE3-BERT draws the inference we challenge, explicitly:

> the oracle outperforms the backbone model and existing exiting strategies by a
> large margin… which indicates **significant room for improving the estimation
> of prediction correctness**

Oracle-above-backbone → headroom. That is the reading this paper argues is
unsafe.

### The four measurements, and how strong each is

| # | claim | evidence | strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | the bound exceeds the network's own full accuracy | +6.86 pt on **90/90** CIFAR runs; **+7.39 / +6.91 pt** on ImageNet-100 @224 px incl. a **transformer**; bootstrap CIs exclude zero 3/3 | **very strong** — an identity, needs no seeds, now across two datasets, two scales and two architecture families |
| **2** | it **grows** with better exits | frozen 6.4–8.0 → joint 8.6–10.6 pt, 3/3 architectures; survives conditioning on accuracy (+2.49 median) | **strong** — paired, one variable, mechanism explained |
| **3** | it does not survive a change of seed | optimism bias **+22.4 pt**, 90 pairs | **medium** — see the caveat below |
| **4** | a deployable gate recovers almost none of it **at ρ = 0.80** | **1.7 %** cross-seed; in-seed no higher, so not noise-memorisation | **strong at that budget**, a lower bound, and **budget-specific** |
| **5** | the honest ceiling is **budget-dependent**, positive below ρ ≈ 0.65 | +7.74 / +7.29 / +3.74 pt at ρ = 0.40 / 0.50 / 0.60, negative from 0.70 up; three exit rules agree within 1.78 pt | **strong** — 15 architectures, and it cross-checks Study 2 to 0.40 pt at ρ = 0.80 |

**Claim 1 is the paper's spine.** It needs one trained network and its own
per-exit predictions. No seeds, no instrument, no assumptions. A bound above
full compute cannot be reached by any router — that is not an empirical finding,
it is what the number means.

**Claim 2 is what makes it publishable rather than pedantic.** The obvious
rebuttal to Claim 1 is *"your exits were weak"*. We tested it and the effect went
the **other** way, with a mechanism: weak exits are right on almost nothing, so
they cannot rescue anything; rescues require competence. **Pre-registered before
the runs**, and a free extrapolation from existing data predicted the direction
and magnitude (+10.98 predicted at exit_quality 0.86; 8.55–10.64 measured at
0.75–0.92).

**Claim 3 is the weakest and must be presented as decomposed.** +22.4 splits
into +6.9 (the exact identity) and +15.3 (cross-seed non-transfer). The second
part conflates "the signal does not transfer" with "acting on a non-transferring
signal is worse than not acting". A reviewer will press this. Report the
decomposition, lead with the +6.9.

### Verification, which is a selling point

Reviewers of a limits paper ask *"how do you know your measurement is right?"* We
have an unusually good answer:

- **96 canaries** across three suites, each required to be able to *fail*
- the load-bearing one: the statistic must **detect** an effect in a world where
  the effect certainly exists — because "no headroom" and "cannot see headroom"
  produce identical output
- identical seeds → bias **exactly 0.0000**; independent seeds → +46.4 pt
- the in-seed oracle is asserted ≥ baseline on every run and holds **90/90**
- **461-check library selftest**
- the routing measurement was implemented wrong **three times** (+5.165, −10, −8
  pt), each producing a plausible number, and each was caught by a canary rather
  than by reading

That history is worth a short "Threats to validity" subsection. It converts an
embarrassment into evidence that the final number was hard to get wrong.

### Where to send it

| venue | fit | realistic? |
|---|---|---|
| **TMLR** | limits/critique work is explicitly in scope; no novelty bar | **submit now** — nothing is missing for it |
| **Pattern Recognition** / **Neural Networks** (Q1, Elsevier) | empirical-analysis papers welcome | **now viable** — the scale gap is closed (2 datasets, 2 scales, conv + transformer) |
| **IEEE TPAMI / IJCV** (Q1) | wants architecture breadth | plausible **after MSDNet** (G1) — built, one ~5 GPU-h run outstanding |
| **NeurIPS/ICML D&B or main** | possible, but reviewers want a method | riskier than TMLR |

**Recommendation: TMLR first.** It is the natural home for "the field's
measurement is wrong and here is the correction", acceptance is on correctness
rather than novelty, and it is indexed and respected. If a JCR-Q1 journal is
specifically required, target *Pattern Recognition* **after** the ImageNet
experiment below.

## The gap analysis — what stands between this and a Q1 journal

Ordered by how much each buys per GPU-hour.

### G1 · A real early-exit architecture · **~5 GPU-h · BUILT, awaiting one run**

Our exits are heads on a staged backbone, trained jointly. The field uses
**MSDNet** and **BranchyNet**, which are architecturally different (dense
multi-scale connections, exits designed in from the start).

**Reviewer question:** *"does your identity hold on the architectures the claim
is about?"* Right now: unknown.

**Experiment.** MSDNet on CIFAR-100, 2 seeds, measured with the same code. It is
a per-run quantity so even one run answers it.
**If the excess persists, Claim 1 becomes architecture-independent** and the
paper's scope widens from "our setup" to "early-exit networks".

> **Status 2026-09-01 — implemented and gated, not yet trained.**
> `msc_lib.MSDNetBackbone` (3 scales × 20 dense layers, exits on the coarsest
> scale) plus `notebooks_study4/S4_NB4_MSDNet.ipynb`. Cost revised from ~15 to
> **~5 GPU-h** now that the architecture exists to be measured.
>
> **All three pre-registered outcomes are already written**, including the one
> where H5 fails. If the excess vanishes on designed exits, the paper does not
> lose a claim — it gains a sharper one: *"oracle early-exit bounds are inflated
> for attached exits and sound for designed ones."* That is more actionable than
> the current claim, and `study4/01_PROTOCOL.md` committed to reporting it with
> equal prominence before the run.
>
> **Caveat that must survive into the manuscript:** this is a re-implementation
> without bottleneck convs or channel-reduction transitions, and it uses the
> project's standard linear exit head rather than MSDNet's two-conv classifier.
> The last is deliberate — the head is held fixed across all 16 architectures,
> so P3 is a statement about the backbone. If H5 lands near 2.0 pt, that
> ambiguity is load-bearing and the paper must say so.

### G2 · Scale · ~~~25 GPU-h~~ · **DONE — objection closed**

> **Completed 2026-08-20.** `resnet50` +7.39 pt, `vit_small_p16` +6.91 pt at
> 224 px on ImageNet-100. H4 and H4b both supported. The text below is the
> original plan, kept for the record.

### G2 · Scale · ~25 GPU-h · **closes the standard objection**

CIFAR-100 at 32px only. You already have an ImageNet-100 pipeline and 2
architectures measured.

**Experiment.** Joint-exit training on ImageNet-100, `resnet50` +
`vit_small_p16`, 1 seed each. **A transformer matters** — every claim we have is
convolutional, and early-exit work is now largely transformer work (DE3-BERT is
BERT). Reuse `notebooks_in100/`.

### G3 · Baselines beyond confidence thresholding · **DONE**

> **Completed 2026-08-20, after a re-run.** Confidence and margin agree within
> **1.78 pt** at every budget; at matched cost confidence 58.03 %, margin
> 58.18 %, patience 55.62 %. **Confidence was not a weak comparator**, so the
> headroom numbers in Studies 2–3 stand. Entropy remains untested — logits were
> never stored.
>
> The first run was void under D-89: an inverted bisection made accuracy *fall*
> as the budget rose. Fixed, verified monotone, re-run. Studies 2–3 were
> **unaffected** — they use a different function whose direction was correct,
> and the two agree to 0.40 pt where they overlap.

### G3 · Baselines beyond confidence thresholding · ~2 GPU-h · **cheapest credibility**

We compare against one baseline. Reviewers will name **entropy thresholding**,
**patience-based exiting (PABEE)**, and **learned exit policies**.

**Experiment.** Entropy and patience baselines are pure re-analysis of the
existing parquets — **no training at all**. A learned policy is Q2's gate, done.
This is nearly free and removes an easy criticism.

### G4 · The operating-point curve as a figure · **free**

`s2_headroom_sweep.csv` already has ρ = 0.40–0.95. It is currently a table.
**Make it Figure 1**: honest headroom versus compute budget, negative across the
whole range, with the in-seed bound plotted above it. One figure carries the
argument.

### G5 · Confidence intervals · **free**

Q1's joint runs are one seed per architecture. The identity does not need seeds,
but reviewers expect error bars. Bootstrap over the **10,000 test samples** —
that is a legitimate interval for a per-run quantity and it costs nothing.

**Remaining to Q1-ready: ~5 GPU-h — one run of `S4_NB4_MSDNet`.**
G2, G3, G4 and G5 are all done. G1 is built, canaried and costed; only the GPU
time is outstanding. The original estimate was ~42 GPU-h, ~27 are spent, and the
last gap turned out to be a third of what it was budgeted at.

## PAPER B — the independent second paper

> ### Softmax difficulty scores are unmeasurable on data the network has memorised.

`ce_loss` seed-reliability falls from **0.647 on held-out data to 0.108** on
training data the network has fit (`mixer_nano`; `convnext_femto` 0.709 → 0.150).
The collapse is predicted by **softmax saturation (ρ = +0.832)** and by train
accuracy (+0.746) — and **not** by test accuracy (**−0.114**), so it is not
"weaker models are noisier". Training-dynamics scores (`el2n`,
`forget_events`) are unaffected.

**Why it matters outside our setting.** Dataset pruning, coreset selection and
curriculum learning compute exactly these scores, on exactly this data, usually
from a single seed — and for the high-capacity models where the collapse is
worst.

**Strength: high.** A large effect, a confirmed mechanism, and a control that
rules out the obvious alternative.

**What it still needs.** A demonstration that the collapse causes *downstream*
harm. Our attempt (Study 3 Q3) is **confounded**: it used "keep the hardest
samples" at 30 % retention, where that rule is known to be poor, so a *more
reliable* score keeps a harder, noisier subset and trains worse. Both guided arms
lost to random — the tell.

**Fix: ~6 GPU-h.** Rerun with the rule inverted (keep easiest) or at mild
retention (70–90 %), reporting both directions. Subsets are index lists, so only
retraining costs.

**With that, Paper B is a standalone Q1 submission** and does not depend on
Paper A being accepted.

---

## What we must not claim

Rule 12 applies to our own manuscript.

- **Not** "adaptive inference does not work." Study 4 P1 shows the opposite at
  aggressive budgets: the honest ceiling is **positive below ρ ≈ 0.65**. The
  negative result is specific to ρ ≥ 0.70.
- **Not** "there is no headroom" without a budget attached. Stated loosely it is
  contradicted by our own sweep.
- **Not** "the excess cannot be reached by any router." A second seed cannot,
  and our gate on exit-local confidence cannot. A gate with pooled embeddings is
  untested.
- **Not** "reliable scores prune worse." Q3 is confounded; the ordering is
  suggestive at best.
- **Not** the +12.45 pt extrapolated figure from P0 — it sits outside the
  observed `exit_quality` range.
- **Not** a magnitude claim across scales. Everything is CIFAR-100.

---

## This is now planned as Study 4

The gap analysis above is scheduled in [`study4/README.md`](study4/README.md),
with pre-registered thresholds in [`study4/01_PROTOCOL.md`](study4/01_PROTOCOL.md).

**Two estimates in this document were corrected when checked:**

- **"extra baselines ~2 GPU-h, pure re-analysis"** — only two-thirds true.
  Margin and patience are free; **entropy is not computable** because only the
  top-2 probabilities were stored, never full logits. Study 4 omits entropy and
  says so rather than approximating it.
- **"ImageNet ~25 GPU-h"** quoted `resnet50`'s **41.5 GPU-h** run, which is the
  D-59 `channels_last` disaster against a documented ~6 h. Revised to ~20 GPU-h
  with a throughput gate in epoch 1.

## Recommended sequence

1. **G4 + G5 + G3** (free / ~2 GPU-h) → **submit Paper A to TMLR.**
2. **Q3 rerun** (~6 GPU-h) → **submit Paper B.**
3. **G1 MSDNet** (~5 GPU-h, **built**) → the architecture-independence result.
4. ~~G2 ImageNet + transformer~~ → **done**; A is JCR-Q1 ready once G1 lands.

Steps 1 and 2 need almost no compute and produce two submissions. Steps 3 and 4
are what turn "correct and careful" into "broad enough for TPAMI".

**The honest summary: you have a publishable result now (TMLR), and ~42 GPU-h
between you and a credible Q1 journal submission.**
