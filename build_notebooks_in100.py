build_notebooks_in100.py -- generate the five ImageNet-100 notebooks.

Five, not seventeen. The CIFAR set was split fine-grained because a Kaggle
session dies at 9-12 hours without warning and a crash mid-notebook cost the
whole notebook. That constraint is gone: this runs on one local machine with no
session limit, so the split can follow the *stages of the experiment* instead of
the platform's failure modes.

    NB1_Setup      one-time. Pack the data, prove offline, preflight all eight
                   architectures, kill-and-resume test. Ends GO / NO-GO.
    NB2_Train      backbones. Phase 0 and the atlas, same notebook, one switch.
    NB3_Measure    exit heads + the three-axis oracle sweep -> per-sample tables
    NB4_Analysis   Q1-Q4, CPU only, minutes
    NB5_Method     MSC-KD (Q5), both arms

Each is independently re-runnable and idempotent: finishing work is skipped,
unfinished work resumes, and nothing is deleted.

`src/msc_lib.py` is the source of truth. These notebooks embed it as base64 and
are GENERATED -- editing the blob does nothing that survives the next rebuild.

# NB1 · Setup — run this once, and read every output

**Nothing else in this project will work until this notebook ends with `GO`.**

It does five things, in an order chosen so the cheap checks fail before the
expensive ones start:

| step | cost | what it catches |
|---|---|---|
| 1. environment | seconds | a CPU-only torch, a missing package |
| 2. offline proof | seconds | a dependency that fetches on first use |
| 3. pack the dataset | 20–40 min | a source tree that differs from the one this port was designed against |
| 4. preflight the zoo | ~5 min GPU | an architecture that cannot run at a resolution the oracle will sweep |
| 5. kill-and-resume | ~5 min GPU | the defect class that has cost this project five separate times |

## Why the preflight matters more than it looks

On CIFAR-100 this step caught three defects **before a single GPU-hour was
spent**: a ViT whose positional embedding was sized for one patch grid, an
MLP-Mixer that cannot run at any other resolution at all, and a budget table
with duplicate entries that would have made MSC mathematically undefined
three hours into a training phase.

The eight architectures here are new and four of them are decomposed from
torchvision. **That decomposition is the part most likely to be wrong**, and
this is where it surfaces.

## What "GO" means

Every architecture builds, forwards, backprops, exits at every stage, prices a
strictly-ascending budget table, and survives a real interrupt. Anything less
and the numbers this project produces would be well-formed and meaningless.

## Step 3 · Pack the dataset

129,395 loose JPEGs → one `256×256` uint8 memmap, with the splits frozen.
**~20–40 minutes on 24 cores, one time.**

You do not have to leave the notebook. The cell below runs the packer as a
subprocess with live output, using the `DATA_DIR` cell 2 already chose. Set
`SRC_DIR` to the folder that contains `train/`, and flip `RUN_PACKER` to True.

### How the labels are assigned

Folders sorted by WNID → class index 0…99. `n01440764` is 0, `n01855672` is 99.
Arbitrary but **deterministic and published**: the mapping lives in
`manifest.json` as `classes` and `class_names`. Nothing downstream depends on
matching official ImageNet indices, so an arbitrary-but-fixed labelling is
exactly right — what would matter is if it changed between runs, and the
fingerprint makes that impossible.

### The fingerprint is the thing to read

```
2b6269ef51ff87b2c9e00fa17c44326ce634a67892c9eb550ec518a6dd2d2b6c
```

A pure function of the file names and the split seeds, so it reproduces on any
machine. **A different value means your source tree differs from the one this
port was designed against.** It goes into `config_hash`, so two runs that
disagree about which 10,000 images are `val` refuse to be compared rather than
producing per-sample tables that align by index and describe different pictures.

restarting.

## Step 4 · Preflight every architecture

Builds all eight, runs a forward and a backward, attaches an exit head to every
stage, and — the important part — **runs each one natively at every resolution
the oracle will sweep**: 96, 128, 160, 192, 224.

### Expect `swin_tiny` to fail at 96px, and possibly 128px

input by 32 (patch-4 then three merges), so its final stage is 7×7 at 224 and
**3×3 at 96 — smaller than its own 7×7 attention window**.

The budget table probes per resolution and falls back to an analytic cost model
for the values that fail, and the *proxy* sweep (downsample-then-upsample) is
primary for all eight architectures anyway. What would be a real problem is the
failure going unrecorded.

### What each check prevents

| check | if it fails |
|---|---|
| builds / forwards / backprops | a torchvision decomposition that mis-ordered blocks |
| exit head attaches at every stage | a feature-rank or memory-layout mismatch (Swin speaks NHWC internally) |
| depth ρ strictly ascending, distinct, ends at 1.0 | **MSC is undefined when two budgets cost the same** |
| native resolution per value | a shape error discovered mid-sweep, hours in |

## Step 5 · Dry-run the whole path, on synthetic data

Before any real training, push one synthetic batch through **the entire path
including evaluation and the artifact write**.

This is here because on CIFAR two defects each cost an hour of GPU time and each
was findable in milliseconds — but at *different* stages. One was the first
training step; the other was the history write at the **end** of epoch 0. A dry
run that stops after `loss.backward()` catches one and moves the other somewhere
else to hide.

So the backbone dry run goes: forward → loss → backward → optimiser step →
`optimisation_health` → `evaluate()` → history row (strict) → checkpoint save →
**checkpoint reload**. And the oracle dry run goes: every axis at every
resolution and precision → difficulty battery → prediction depth → per-sample
frame → parquet write → **parquet read back** → `compute_msc`.

**Do not skip this.** Five separate defects in the CIFAR programme were about
resume, and the worst of them silently restarted nine completed runs from epoch
0 — roughly 30 GPU-hours, with no error and no warning, because a re-trained run
looks exactly like normal work.

The test fires a **real interrupt** mid-run and then resumes in a fresh call. It
compares **per-epoch training loss after the seam**, not final accuracy: final
accuracy can match by luck, the loss curve cannot. An earlier version of this
test simulated a kill by training a shorter run and asking for more epochs —
that is a clean completion followed by an extension, a completely different code

## What you will see while it runs

A live bar per epoch, with the numbers that matter updating **beside** it about
once a second:

```
ep 7/100  63%|███████████▌      | 738/1178 [04:12<02:31, loss=3.412, acc=0.221, img/s=402, lr=8.7e-02, vram=2.9G]
```

An epoch here is 3–35 minutes. A bar showing only position tells you the run is
alive but not whether it is *learning*, and during a multi-day programme those
are the two separate questions you actually have.

Then one line per epoch, carrying what you would otherwise have to open
`epochs.csv` to see:

```
  ep   7/100  train 22.14%  val 19.83%  top5 45.12%  loss 3.412  lr 8.66e-02  402 img/s  289s  ETA 9.3h  0.041kWh  *BEST*
```

### Warnings that appear inline, and what each one means

These are the columns that are **silent by default and unrecoverable
afterwards**, so they are surfaced while they are happening rather than left in
a CSV nobody reads by eye:

| tag | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `[N NaN/Inf BATCHES]` | under AMP a non-finite loss is **discarded silently**. The run continues and learns nothing from those batches | a handful is normal early; hundreds means the LR is too high |
| `[N AMP OVERFLOWS]` | gradient overflows whose steps were **thrown away** | >5% of steps is a problem |
| `[LR HIGH?]` | ‖Δw‖/‖w‖ above 1e-2 | healthy is ~1e-3. Stop and check |
| `[NOT MOVING?]` | ‖Δw‖/‖w‖ below 1e-5 | nothing is learning |
| `[DATA-BOUND N%]` | the loader is the bottleneck, not the model | raise `num_workers` |

`[DATA-BOUND]` is trustworthy now: device-side augmentation is measured
separately and subtracted, so this counts genuine CPU starvation only.

---

## Run Phase 0 first. Then stop and read the gate.

**Phase 0:** `resnet50` and `vit_small_p16`, 2 seeds each. **4 runs, ~1.5 days.**

That gives one noise ceiling per family, which is the entire question:

| ρ_seed outcome | meaning | action |
|---|---|---|
| ViT below CNN by **> 0.05** | the CIFAR finding reproduces | build the atlas |
| within **±0.05** | **it was a small-data artifact** | retract the CIFAR headline; the paper becomes about scale-dependence |
| ViT **above** CNN by > 0.05 | inversion | stop, audit the measurement |
| either below **0.40** | noise-dominated at this scale | coarsen the grid, re-gate |

All four are publishable. **Row 1 flatters the existing paper, so scrutinise it
harder than the others**: check both architectures cleared the acceptance
thresholds, seed spread is under 2 points, `nan_or_inf_batches` is 0, and both
ceilings used a comparable sample count after the τ mask.

## Cost, from measurement rather than estimate

The plan estimated 235 GPU-hours. **Your benchmark says otherwise**, and the
shape of the answer changes what is worth running.

`vgg16` is now **45% of the entire atlas budget** for one across-CNN-family data
point. It strengthens Q3's family ordering; the Q1 headline — the reason this
replication exists — does not need it.

**You do not have to decide yet.** Phase 0 contains no `vgg16` and costs ~1.5
days. If the gap fails to reproduce, the atlas shrinks to the 2×2 anyway and
the question is moot.

Two caveats on the numbers below, both flagged in the table:

- `resnet50` and `vgg16` were measured with `cudnn.benchmark = False` — torch's
  default, and **not** what training uses (D-43). `resnet50` at 82 img/s against
  `resnet18`'s 413 is a 5× gap for 2.3× the FLOPs; expect ~180 once re-measured.
- `vit_small_p16` and `deit_small` **failed to build** in that run (D-42, fixed)

# NB3 · Measure — the oracle sweep

Turns trained backbones into **per-sample MSC tables**, which are the
scientific artifact of the whole project.

For every run:

1. **Train exit heads** — K linear heads on the frozen backbone. Freezing is not
   an optimisation, it is the definition: if the backbone adapted while the
   heads trained, each exit would read a *different* network and the "same model
   under reduced compute" interpretation collapses.
2. **Sweep every configuration on every sample** — depth (K exits), resolution
   (5 native + 5 proxy), precision (5). No early-exit shortcut: the
   stable-sufficiency definition quantifies over *all larger* budgets, so
   stopping at the first agreement would record exactly the accidental early
   agreement the definition exists to reject.
3. **Compute the difficulty battery** and prediction depth.
4. **Write** `per_sample/test.parquet` and `per_sample/train_holdout.parquet`.

Inference-only and idempotent — ~1 GPU-h per run, and re-running skips anything
already measured.

## Why `train_holdout` exists

EL2N and forgetting-events are **training-set** quantities, undefined on any
split the model never trained on. Running Q4 without them handicaps the
difficulty battery, which flatters MSC — that is exactly the defect that
inflated the CIFAR ΔR² by 2.5× and had to be withdrawn.

`train_holdout` is 15,000 training images evaluated with augmentation off. It is
not held out of training.

## The coverage alarm at the end is not decoration

On CIFAR, six runs were trained and never measured — the cheapest architectures,
which the scheduler places last. One architecture ended up with **zero** measured
seeds, contributed nothing to any analysis, and the atlas was 14 architectures
while every document said 15. A noise ceiling needs **two** measured seeds
minimum.

# NB4 · Analysis — Q1 to Q4

CPU only. Minutes, not hours. Re-run it as often as you like.

## Q1 is the whole point of this replication

Everything else here is secondary and would still be worth reporting, but the
question this project exists to answer is:

> On CIFAR-100, ViT and Mixer showed seed-reliability of **0.547** against
> **0.62–0.73** for every CNN. Does that survive at ImageNet scale, or was it a
> small-data artifact?

Q1 measures the **noise ceiling** ρ_seed: the Spearman correlation between the
per-sample MSC of two seeds of the *same* architecture. It is not a side
experiment — it is the denominator every transfer number gets divided by, and
it is the single most important quantity in the project.

## Read Q1 with the confound in mind

The eight architectures were trained for **equal epochs**, so schedule length is
not a variable — which it *was* on CIFAR (240 vs 300). But ViTs from scratch on
129k images will still land below the CNNs in accuracy, so **family and accuracy
remain partly confounded** and that must be stated wherever the result is.

The design carries three answers to it, and none of them is "the marginal means
look fine":

1. **`swin_tiny` vs `vit_small_p16`** — both attention; only Swin has locality
   and hierarchy. If reliability tracks *attention*, they agree. If it tracks
   *weak spatial prior*, Swin sits with the CNNs.
2. **`convnext_tiny` vs `resnet50`** — both convolution; only ConvNeXt uses the
   transformer design language.
3. **`vit_small_p16` vs `deit_small`** — **identical geometry, built by one
   function with one argument set**, differing only in augmentation strength.
   If ρ_seed differs across this pair, reliability is a property of *training*,
   not of attention — which would reframe the CIFAR finding rather than confirm
   it.

Together 1 and 2 form a 2×2: {conv, attention} × {strong prior, weak prior}. If
the effect is about attention the split runs along one diagonal; if it is about
spatial prior, the other.

## And one direct bridge

`shufflenetv2` is the only architecture measured in **both** studies. Its CIFAR
ρ_seed is **0.6698**. Whatever it reads here, the *difference* is a measurement
of what dataset scale alone does, with architecture held exactly fixed. It
calibrates every other comparison in the table.

## Paper outputs

Every contribution the protocol claims has to be backed by an artifact on disk,
or it is a claim and not a result. This cell writes them and then **checks the
list**, so a missing table is reported rather than discovered while writing.

| # | contribution (protocol §8.1) | artifact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | MSC: per-sample, cost-normalised, multi-axis, stability-closed | `runs/*/per_sample/*.parquet` + `budgets/*.json` |
| 2 | first measurement of whether compute-need is one-dimensional across axes | `analysis/q2_axis_structure_all.csv`, Table 3 |
| 3 | first noise-ceiling-corrected cross-architecture transfer study | `analysis/q1_seed_ceilings_all.csv`, `q3_transfer_matrix.csv`, Tables 2 and 4 |
| 4 | irreducibility to seven classical difficulty scores | `analysis/q4_irreducibility_all.csv`, Table 5 |
| 5 | MSC-KD, benchmarked at matched FLOPs | NB5 → `analysis/q5_method_comparison.csv` |
| 6 | fully reproducible artifact | `paper/provenance.csv`, `tables/`, every config and log |

### The one this replication adds

**Contribution 3 is where the novelty concentrates**, and it is sharper here
than on CIFAR. The methodological point is that *measurement reliability is
itself architecture-dependent*, so a cross-architecture difficulty study that
does not disattenuate is comparing quantities measured with unequal precision —
and the example-difficulty literature generally does not.

CIFAR demonstrated that. This tests whether it **survives a 40× increase in
dataset size and a 49× increase in pixels**, with four independent crossings of
the CNN/attention boundary and one architecture held fixed across both studies.
Either answer is a result; the second is a self-retraction, which is rarer and
more useful than the first.

# NB5 · MSC-KD — the method (Q5)

**Only run this after Q1–Q4 are in.** The method is the last section of the
paper, not its thesis: Q1, Q2 and Q3 are publishable whichever way this goes.

Distils the teacher's per-sample compute requirement into a student's monotone
routing policy. Three loss terms, two weights:

    L = L_CE + α·L_KD + β·L_MSC

Monotonicity is architectural, not a penalty — the sufficiency head is a
cumulative-link ordinal head whose thresholds are `θ_{k+1} = θ_k + softplus(δ_k)`,
so the predicted curve is non-decreasing in k **by construction**. A constraint
that cannot be violated beats a soft penalty that can trade off against other
terms.

## Both arms run in one pass

The **scrambled control** (MSC targets permuted within the batch) trains first.
If it matches the real arm, `L_MSC` is a regulariser and not a signal, and you
need to know that before writing anything.

This used to be a module-level flag with a comment saying which value to run
first. The flag defaulted to the control, four sessions in a row trained the
control, and the real arm never existed. **An invariant in a comment is not a
mechanism** — so both arms are a loop now, and whether a run is scrambled is
derived from its own `run_id`.

## The budget count comes from the student, never the teacher

A student's usable exits are adaptive: `resnet18` and `resnet50` do not have the
same number. Sizing the router from the *teacher's* budget grid produces a model
that trains fine — the loss only ever compares the head against targets, both on
the teacher's grid — and then fails at *evaluation*, where routing indexes the
student's actual exits. It is a modelling error, not a shape bug: the routing
decision spends **the student's** compute, so the teacher's grid is meaningless.

That defect took six rounds to fix because it was patched one call site at a
time, and one of those rounds recreated it *inside the dry run written to catch
it*.

# NB6 · Publish — mirror the local tree to HuggingFace

Everything so far has been **local only**. This notebook is the one place that
uploads, and it is the last step by design: an artifact that has not been
verified on disk should not be published.

## The layout is the local tree, unchanged

`run_layout()` was written so the local tree and the repo tree are the same
shape — a push is a relative-path calculation, never a guess. The CIFAR study
uses exactly this layout under `Shanmuk4622/msc-cifar100`, and ImageNet-100
mirrors it under `Shanmuk4622/msc-imagenet100`:

```

```

One repo, one folder per run. The CIFAR study tried a two-repo split
(models + data) and reverted it: HuggingFace's write limit is **per user**, so
two uploaders doubled commit consumption for no benefit, and a run's artifacts
belong together. See `docs/cifar100/03_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §6.2(d).

## Rate limit

HF allows roughly 120 commits/hour/user. This uploads in **batched commits**
(one commit per run, not per file) and reports the count before it starts, so a
push of 22 runs costs ~22 commits rather than ~400.
