"""
build_notebooks.py -- regenerate the Kaggle notebooks from src/msc_lib.py.

Why a generator instead of hand-written notebooks
-------------------------------------------------
The E2AM notebooks embed their library as a base64 blob in cell 1. That is
robust -- no pip install of a private package, no git clone, no path fragility,
and it survives "Run All" from a cold Kaggle session. But it is also write-only:
changing one line means decoding, patching and re-encoding by hand.

So we keep the base64 bootstrap and remove the opacity. `src/msc_lib.py` is the
readable source of truth; this script embeds it (plus `msc_core.py`, the
reference implementation of every statistic) and writes the .ipynb files.

Sixteen notebooks, so that any single one is short enough to finish, and any
notebook with more than one independent model to train is worker-sharded.

Usage
-----
    python build_notebooks.py            # regenerate
    python build_notebooks.py --check    # verify the .ipynb files are current

        ## What this notebook is for

        Every check below corresponds to a specific failure that would otherwise
        surface hours into a real run:

        | Check | What it saves you from |
        |---|---|
        | HuggingFace reachable **and writable** | Nine hours of training with nowhere to put it |
        | CIFAR-100 found | Silently falling back to a slow download |
        | All 15 model types build and train | A Vision Transformer whose internals don't fit our measurement code |
        | FLOPs measured correctly | A compute scale that doesn't actually reach 100% |
        | **Kill-and-resume works** | See below — this is the important one |
        | Worker splitting is balanced | One account working 33 hours while another idles |

        ## Why the resume test matters more than it looks

        We kill a training run halfway and restart it, then check the result is
        *identical* to an uninterrupted run.

        The subtle failure it catches: a resume that reloads the model but not
        the random-number state. Training looks fine. But the resumed run now
        sees images in a different order than it would have. That breaks the
        meaning of "same model, different random seed" — which is exactly the
        comparison Q1 relies on, and Q1 is the denominator of every number in
        the paper.

        So we don't assume it works. We test it.

        ## Step 4 — Measure the compute cost of every setting

        This builds the table that defines what "50% compute" *means* for each
        architecture.

        `rho` is the fraction-of-full-cost for each setting. It's the number
        that lets us compare a ResNet to a Transformer at all — without it,
        "needed 12 layers" and "needed 6 blocks" aren't comparable quantities.

        Two columns worth understanding:

        **`K`** is how many distinct depth settings that architecture supports.
        Usually 5. But `resnet8x4` has only 3 blocks in total, so it physically
        cannot have five distinct early-exit points — it gets K=3. That's
        correct, not a bug: MSC is a cost *fraction*, not an exit index, so
        architectures may carry different K and still be comparable. (Forcing 5
        would produce duplicate budgets, which makes "the smallest sufficient

        {HEADER_NOTE}

        ## What we're doing and why

        Before spending ~1,200 GPU-hours, we spend 12 to find out whether the
        thing we want to measure is even measurable.

        Four models:

        | Model | Seed | Why |
        |---|---|---|
        | resnet32x4 | 1 | reference model A |
        | resnet32x4 | 2 | **the same model, different random start** |
        | wrn-40-2 | 1 | a different architecture, B |
        | wrn-40-2 | 2 | **same again, different random start** |

        The duplicate seeds are not redundancy. They answer: *when we train the
        exact same thing twice, do the two copies agree about which images are
        hard?*

        That agreement is our **noise ceiling** — the reference point that makes
        every later number interpretable. If two copies of the same model only
        agree 60% of the time, then a ResNet and a ViT agreeing 55% is actually
        near-perfect. Without the ceiling, 55% is just a number.

        ## What to expect

        These are standard, published architectures on a standard recipe, so we
        know what accuracy they should reach: **resnet32x4 ≈ 79.4%**,
        **wrn-40-2 ≈ 75.6%**.

        The notebook checks this and warns loudly if a run lands more than 1
        point low. That matters because measuring "how much compute does this
        image need" on a badly-trained model gives meaningless answers — and a
        badly-trained model is otherwise easy to miss.

        ## Timing

        ~3 hours per model. With `NUM_WORKERS = 4`, one per account, about
        3 hours total. With 1 worker, about 12 hours across two sessions
        (it pauses and resumes automatically at the 8.5-hour mark).

        {HEADER_NOTE}

        ## What we're doing

        We now have four trained models. For each one we ask, **for every one of
        the 10,000 test images**: how little computation is enough?

        Three steps per model:

        **1. Attach early-exit points.** A trained network is one long pipeline.
        We attach five small "read-off points" at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of
        the way through, so we can see what the network would answer if it
        stopped early.

        These read-off points need a few minutes of training themselves — but
        **the main network is frozen solid** while that happens. This is not an
        optimisation, it's the definition: if the main network were allowed to
        adapt, each exit would be reading a *different* network, and "the same
        model with less compute" would stop being true.

        **2. Run every setting on every image.** Five depth settings, five
        resolutions (measured two ways), five numeric precisions — 20 settings ×
        10,000 images per model. We record what the model answered and how
        confident it was, every time.

        No shortcuts here. We can't stop at the first setting that gets the right
        answer, because our definition requires the answer to be *settled* —
        correct at that budget and every larger one. Checking that requires
        actually looking at all of them.

        **3. Also measure the "usual" difficulty scores.** Seven of them, so we
        can later test whether our new measurement is genuinely new or just an
        old idea renamed (that's Q4).

        ## The output

        Two Parquet tables per model: one for the test set, one for a 5,000-image
        slice of training data. **These tables are the actual scientific product
        of this project.** The model weights matter much less — we could throw
        them away and still write the paper.

        ## This is the most important notebook in the project

        It answers: **is there a project here?**

        We compute three numbers from the Phase 0 measurements and read off a
        verdict.

        | | What it measures | Pass |
        |---|---|---|
        | **ρ_seed** | Two copies of the same model — do they agree about which images are hard? | ≥ 0.6 |
        | **T** | Two *different* architectures — do they agree, after correcting for the noise above? | ≥ 0.7 |
        | **ΔR²** | Does our measurement say anything that existing "difficulty" scores don't? | ≥ 0.05 |

        ## The five possible verdicts

        | Verdict | What it means | What you do |
        |---|---|---|
        | **FULL-PROGRAM** | Everything works | Build the whole thing |
        | **REFRAME** | Real and transfers, but it's just "difficulty" renamed | Still a paper: "cheap scores are enough" |
        | **PIVOT-STRONG-NEGATIVE** | Real, but does NOT transfer | **Still a paper — arguably the best one.** The field's assumption is wrong |
        | **MARGINAL** | Borderline | Use coarser settings, re-analyse, no retraining |
        | **FAIL** | It's noise | Retry once, then switch direction |

        **Three of five lead to a paper.** That was the entire point of designing
        the project this way — its value isn't contingent on one method winning.

        ## One thing to check before believing any of it

        Step 4 runs a **deliberately scrambled** comparison. We shuffle one
        model's answers and re-measure agreement. It must come out at
        approximately zero.

        If it doesn't, we have a bug — not a discovery. The cell stops if so.

        Depth, resolution and precision on the same model, same images. How much

        **A note on which resolution measurement we use.** There are two honest
        ways to reduce resolution: actually run the network on a smaller image
        (`res_native`), or shrink-then-restore so the network shape is unchanged
        and only information content drops (`res_proxy`).

        Native is cleaner in principle. But MLP-Mixer *cannot* run at another
        resolution — its token-mixing layer is a linear map whose input
        dimension is literally the patch count. So if we made native primary, 14
        architectures would be measured one way and one another way, and any
        cross-architecture claim on this axis would compare two different
        quantities.

        So **the proxy is primary** (uniform across all 15) and native is
        reported as a robustness check for the 14 that support it. The protocol
        says to decide this in Phase 0 and stay consistent — this is that
        decision. Step 6b checks the two agree.

        {HEADER_NOTE}

        ## Only run this if NB11 said transfer works

        If transfer failed, the paper is the negative result and this is wasted
        compute. Check `analysis/q3_transfer_matrix.csv` first.

        ## What we're building

        A small "student" network that, besides doing its job, predicts **how
        much computation each image needs** — learned from a big "teacher"
        network's measurements.

        At deployment: the student looks at an image briefly, decides how much
        more thinking it deserves, and spends accordingly.

        ## Three ideas that make it defensible

        **1. Three loss terms, two knobs.** Do the task, imitate the teacher's
        answers, imitate the teacher's compute assessment. An earlier version of
        this project had seven terms and six knobs, which no realistic experiment
        budget can justify and which reads to a reviewer as "we tried everything".

        **2. The prediction is forced to make sense by construction.** "Enough
        compute at 80%" must imply "enough at 100%". Rather than adding a penalty
        that discourages violations, we use a head shape that makes them
        *impossible*. It can't be violated, adds no knob, and can't be traded off
        against the other terms.

        **3. The decision is made early and cheaply.** The compute-need predictor
        reads the *earliest* features. A router that needs deep features to decide
        not to compute deep features saves nothing.

        ## Run the scrambled version FIRST

        Set `SHUFFLE_ABLATION = True`, run it, then set it to `False` and run
        again.

        The scrambled version gives the student **deliberately wrong** compute
        targets. If it performs just as well, then the compute signal isn't doing
        anything — the loss term is just acting as a generic regulariser, and our
        central claim is wrong.

        Better to find that out now than after writing the paper.

        ## The comparison that decides Q5

        Three things on the same axes:

        | | What it is | Why it's here |
        |---|---|---|
        | **B2** | Route by the student's own confidence | **What the field actually deploys.** The real rival |
        | **B10** | Route by our teacher-distilled compute prediction | Ours |
        | **B11** | Route by the student's *true* compute-need, measured after the fact | The ceiling — the best any router could do |

        **The result is not "B10 beats B1".** Beating a non-adaptive baseline is
        trivial. The result is **what fraction of the B2→B11 gap does B10
        close?** B2 is where we are, B11 is where we could be, and the fraction
        in between is the contribution.

        ## Equal compute or it means nothing

        Every comparison is at **matched average FLOPs**. A method that's more
        accurate while using more compute hasn't demonstrated anything. We sweep
        the full accuracy-vs-compute curve for each and compare at equal cost.

        ## An honest limitation we state up front

        Per-image routing gives **no wall-clock speedup under batched inference**
        unless you split the batch by route. A reviewer will raise this, so we
        raise it first: the deployment claim is scoped to batch-size-1, edge and
        streaming settings, where it genuinely holds.

        # NB16 — Fix: finish the atlas

        {HEADER_NOTE}

        ## What this notebook is for

        The atlas is **one training run and a handful of measurements short of
        complete**, and the shortfall is not random. The work scheduler packs
        runs by estimated cost and places the *cheapest* ones last, so when a
        Kaggle session hits its time limit the small architectures are what
        gets dropped. `wrn_16_2` (cost 1.70) and `vgg8` (cost 1.34) are the two
        least expensive models in the zoo, which is exactly why they are the
        ones missing. See defect **D-15**.

        ## Why it is worth ~3.5 GPU-hours

        `wrn_16_2` currently has **one** measured seed. A noise ceiling needs
        two, so it contributes to **nothing** — not Q1, not Q2, not Q3, not Q4.
        The atlas is being described as fifteen architectures and analysed as
        thirteen.

        | run | state | what finishing it buys |
        |---|---|---|
        | `wrn_16_2` s1 | **not trained** | third seed |
        | `wrn_16_2` s2 | trained, unmeasured | **the ceiling — this is the one that matters** |
        | `wrn_40_1` s3 | trained, unmeasured | 2 seeds → 3, tighter ceiling |
        | `vgg8` s1 | trained, unmeasured | 2 seeds → 3, tighter ceiling |
        | `mixer_nano` s3 | trained, unmeasured | 2 → 3 on a **low-ceiling** model where the extra seed is worth most |

        Measuring `wrn_16_2` s2 alone takes the atlas from 13 architectures to
        14. Training s1 as well takes it to the full 15 with three seeds each.

        ## It finds the gaps itself

        Nothing below is hard-coded. The notebook reads the ledger and the
        per-sample tables and works out what is missing, so it stays correct as
        you run it — and it is safe to re-run at any time. If everything is
        already done it says so and stops.

        |---|---|---|
        | train | ≤ 1 | ~0.9 GPU-h |
        | measure | ≤ 5 | ~0.5 GPU-h each |
        | **total** | | **~3.5 GPU-h — one session** |

        also be measured here.
