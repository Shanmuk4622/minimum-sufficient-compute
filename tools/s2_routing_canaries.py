"""Canaries for route_by / route_confidence in S2_NB2.

The first version of these helpers had two defects that together produced a
+5.165 point 'result':
  * only exits 0 and K-1 were ever reachable (a 2-exit binary split);
  * the 'confidence baseline' thresholded the FINAL exit's confidence, which
    costs a full forward pass -- an oracle, not a deployable baseline.

Each canary below must fail if the corresponding property is broken.
Usage:  python tools/s2_routing_canaries.py
