validate_notebooks.py -- refuse to ship a notebook that names a column or a
repo path that does not exist.

Rules 3 and 4, as mechanisms rather than intentions:

    3. Column names are data. Validate every string literal against the schema
       at BUILD time, not at run time. Five wrong names once killed 9 runs at
       the end of epoch 0.
    4. Never spell a repo path as a string literal in a notebook. Go through
       one accessor, so a wrong path is an import error not a silent miss.

Both have already cost this project real time, twice each:

  D-22  `train_msc_kd` wrote five column names that are not columns
        (`f1_score`, `precision`, `recall`, `grad_norm`, `throughput_img_s`).
        `csv.DictWriter` raised -- at the END of the first epoch, after the
        training was done and the time unrecoverable. Nine runs.
  D-36  NB15 asked for three telemetry columns that do not exist. GPU fields
        are per device (`gpu0_*`), so there is no un-suffixed name. The build
        loop guarded every access and skipped them silently; the display two
        lines later did not, and that is where it died.
  D-16  `exit_heads.pt` written outside the documented layout. Closed as
        "cosmetic -- nothing reads the path by convention."
  D-23  Three things read it by convention. Every MSC-KD run retrained the
        teacher's exit heads for a file that had been on HuggingFace since NB08.

The pattern in all four is the same: a literal that nothing compared against
the thing it refers to. Comparing them is mechanical, takes milliseconds, and
is therefore the only sane place to do it.

The schema is IMPORTED from msc_lib rather than re-parsed out of it. Re-parsing
would create a second copy of the truth, which is the D-16 defect in a new
costume.

    Rule 12 and rule 8. A validator reporting "0 problems" is worth exactly the

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    THE TWO DEFECTS HAVE DIFFERENT OWNERS, and finding that out is what this
    self-test was for.

    Writing this checker, the obvious move was to make it catch both D-22 and

    `f1_score` are LEGITIMATE internal dict keys inside `msc_lib` -- see
    `EpochTelemetry`, which returns `{"grad_norm": ...}`. They are simply not
    CSV column names; the columns are `grad_norm_mean` and `f1_macro`. D-22 was
    using the internal key where the column name was needed. No static check
    over string literals can tell those apart, because they are the same string.

    So:

      D-22 (WRITING a row with keys the schema lacks)
          owned by `append_history_row(strict=True)`, which raises and names the
          column you probably meant. Asserted below against the real five.

      D-36 (READING a column that exists nowhere)
          owned by this checker. Asserted below against the real three.

    Splitting them is the honest answer. Claiming this checker covered both
    would be the kind of "it's handled" that D-16 was closed with.
