# ImageNet-100 — LIVE STATUS

**Updated:** 2026-08-13 · self-test 423/423 · all notebook cells parse as Python 3.10

## PRE-REGISTERED GATES — measured

| gate | value | threshold | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| ρ_seed ≥ 0.60 | resnet50 **0.822** · vit **0.649** | 0.60 | **PASS** |
| shuffled control \|z\| < 5 | **2.30** | 5.0 | **PASS** |
| Q4 partial ρ ≥ 0.30 | **0.282** | 0.30 | **MISS** |
| Q4 ΔR² ≥ 0.05 | **0.0411** | 0.05 | **MISS** |

**H4 requires BOTH ΔR² ≥ 0.05 and partial ρ ≥ 0.30. Both miss.** An earlier
version of this file said only the partial Spearman missed — ΔR² = 0.0411 is
also below its 0.05 bar. The CI [0.0352, 0.0468] excludes zero, so MSC *does*
carry information beyond the 7-score difficulty battery; it does not carry
enough to clear the pre-registered threshold.

CIFAR's transformer pairs missed the same gate (median 0.0425). **The weakness
replicates** — see `26_IN100_FINDINGS.md` §2.5.

**Q3 transfer, resnet50 ↔ vit_small_p16 (CNN–transformer):**
ρ_raw 0.468 → **T = 0.640** [0.614, 0.664] after disattenuation.
Shuffled control gives T = 0.037 — a 17× separation, so the alignment is real.
Jaccard@top-10 = 0.259.

## 0. CAN THE PAPER BE WRITTEN FROM WHAT IS ON DISK? — read this first

**Nothing needs retraining.** All 22 runs (4 backbones + 18 students), their
100-epoch histories and their checkpoints are intact: 4.4 GiB of `p3-*` alone.

| claim | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1 seed ceilings** | **PROVEN within IN-100** | resnet50 **0.822** vs vit **0.649**, both above the 0.60 gate. The CNN>ViT *ordering* replicates CIFAR. Cross-study *magnitudes* are confounded — see §FIRST RESULT |
| **Q2 multi-axis** | **PROVEN** | PC1 explains 0.547 / 0.522 — MSC is not one axis in disguise |
| **Q3 transfer** | **PROVEN** | T = **0.640** [0.614, 0.664]; shuffled control T = 0.037, a 17× separation |
| **Q4 irreducibility** | **MISSED (both criteria)** | ΔR² **0.0411** < 0.05 and partial ρ **0.282** < 0.30. CI excludes zero, so the effect is real but under the bar. CIFAR missed it too (0.0425) — replicates |
| **Q5 MSC-KD** | **COMPLETE — NEGATIVE** | at ρ=0.806: B10 is **−0.0088** vs B2 in **18/18** runs; B11 oracle offers **+0.00007** headroom |

**The paper's thesis is Q1–Q3, and it is already provable.** The headline —
*ViT's low seed-reliability survives at ImageNet scale, and the CNN/ViT gap
widens rather than closes* — rests entirely on results that exist and are
verified on disk.

Q5 is the method section. It is a section, not the thesis; NB5's own header
says so. What is missing there is one evaluation pass, not a single epoch of
training.

### What is genuinely NOT proven, and why

1. **n = 2 seeds** for the backbones. ρ_seed has no error bar. The plan said 3.
   This is the one real limitation of the pilot and it is a *training* gap —
   the only thing on this page that would cost GPU-days to close.
2. **Q4 missed its gate** by 0.018. Report it as a miss.
3. **2 architectures, not 8.** The `p1` atlas has not been run. No CNN-vs-ViT
   claim can rest on one of each.
4. **MSC-KD is a negative result, and a clean one.** Accuracy real-vs-control
   +0.0020 (t = +1.02, null). At matched FLOPs (ρ = 0.806) MSC-KD is 0.0088
   *below* confidence routing in 18/18 runs — and the **B11 oracle ceiling is
   only +0.00007 above confidence**, so routing by the student's own true MSC
   would not help either. The limitation is the premise, not the distillation.
   That is publishable as a negative, and it is why the B11 baseline exists.

### Whose fault, concretely

Mine, and the mechanism is worth recording rather than apologising for:
`compare_routing_methods` (the reader) was written and wired; nothing ever
checked that a writer existed. `evaluate_routing_methods` was called only from
`msckd_dry_run`. **The dry run measured the paper's central quantity; the real
run did not.** That is D-55's shape on the output side, and the fourth
reader/writer mismatch in this project (D-63, D-72, D-74, D-79).

There is now a self-test that fails if any column `compare_routing_methods`
reads has no writer in the source, and one that fails if `train_msc_kd` does
not call the evaluator.

This is the "where are we" file. One page, updated every session.

## 1. The question this run exists to answer

On CIFAR-100, ViT and Mixer showed **low seed-reliability** — ρ_seed 0.547,
against 0.62–0.73 for CNNs. MSC either measures something stable about an
architecture, or it partly measures the seed.

**Does that gap survive at ImageNet scale, or was it a small-data artifact?**

Everything below is scaffolding for that one comparison. ρ_seed is the
denominator of every transfer claim in the paper; if it is unstable, nothing
above it means anything.

## FIRST RESULT — corrected, and weaker than first stated

**ρ_seed at τ=0.1.** An earlier version of this file claimed *"the gap widened
from ~0.10 to 0.173"*. That claim does not survive checking, and the reason
matters more than the number.

| | CIFAR-100 | ImageNet-100 |
|---|---|---|
| CNN | 12 archs, mean **0.6683**, range 0.622–0.722 | `resnet50` **0.8220** (n=1) |
| non-CNN | `vit_tiny` 0.5475, `mixer_nano` 0.5470 | `vit_small_p16` **0.6492** (n=1) |
| gap | **+0.1210** | **+0.1728** |

### What is NOT supported

**No architecture is shared between the two studies.** CIFAR ran `vit_tiny`;
ImageNet ran `vit_small_p16`. CIFAR ran twelve small CNNs; ImageNet ran
`resnet50`. So every cross-study number bundles **architecture + resolution +
dataset** into one difference, and none of them can be attributed to scale:

- "ViT's ρ_seed rose 0.547 → 0.649" compares `vit_tiny`@32px to
  `vit_small_p16`@224px. Different model, different resolution.
- "the gap widened 0.121 → 0.173" is one CNN and one ViT against twelve and
  two. With n=1 per family on ImageNet there is no error bar on that 0.173.
- `table6_cifar_vs_imagenet.csv` says it plainly: `same_architecture = False`
  on both rows, and the CIFAR column is empty because there is no match to
  join on.

Note also that `vit_small_p16` at 0.649 sits **inside** the CIFAR CNN range
(0.622–0.722). "ViT is unreliable in absolute terms" is not a scale-invariant
statement.

### What IS supported

**The ordering replicates.** Within ImageNet-100 — same dataset, same
resolution, same recipe family, same pipeline — the CNN is more seed-reliable
than the ViT: **0.822 vs 0.649**. CIFAR found the same direction across 14
architectures.

That is an *independent replication with non-overlapping architectures*, which
is arguably stronger evidence that the phenomenon is not architecture-specific
than re-running the same model would have been. It is also a much narrower
claim than the one this file made yesterday, and it is the one the data
supports.

**To say anything quantitative about scale**, the study needs either an
architecture present in both (`convnext` and `shufflenetv2` exist in both
zoos), or ≥3 architectures per family on ImageNet. Both are training, not
analysis.

**Phase 0 is a 2-architecture pilot, not the study.** The 8-architecture
atlas is phase `p1` and has not been started.

### Trained runs (NB2 output — all verified on disk)

| run | state | epochs | best top-1 | img/s | GPU-h | train artifacts | measured |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `resnet50-s1` | completed | 100 | **82.62%** | 80 | 41.5 | OK | **yes** |
| `resnet50-s2` | completed | 100 | **82.12%** | 80 | 41.5 | OK | **yes** |
| `vit_small_p16-s1` | completed | 100 | **60.56%** | 603 | 5.7 | OK | **yes** |
| `vit_small_p16-s2` | completed | 100 | **61.01%** | 595 | 5.7 | OK | **yes** |

Seed pairs agree to 0.50 (resnet50) and 0.45 (vit) points.

The `img/s` column is why `resnet50` cost 7× what `vit` did — see §5.

## 3. What each notebook does and produces

| NB | does | writes per run | reruns safely? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NB1** | pack JPEGs → uint8 memmap; build FLOPs budgets | `msc_data/in100/*`, `budgets/*.json` | yes, skips if packed |
| **NB2** | train backbones | `epochs.csv`, `ckpt_last/best.pt`, `train_dynamics.parquet`, telemetry, `summary.json` | yes, resumes mid-run |
| **NB3** | exit heads + final eval + **oracle sweep** | `exit_heads.pt`, `final.csv`, `confusion_matrix.csv`, `per_class.csv`, `exit_metrics.csv`, **`per_sample/test.parquet`**, `train_holdout.parquet`, `meta.json` | yes, skips measured runs |
| **NB4** | Q1–Q4 analysis | `analysis/*.csv`, `tables/`, `paper/figures/` | yes, pure read |
| **NB5** | MSC-KD: trains **18 new runs** | new `p3-*` runs | yes, resumes |

**`per_sample/test.parquet` is the scientific artifact.** Everything in the
paper is computed from it. Until NB3 writes it, no analysis exists.

## 4. Order — and the answer to "can I go to NB5?"

```
NB1 → NB2 → NB3 → NB4 → NB5
             ^you are here
```

**NB3 is done** — all four runs measured, per-sample tables on disk. NB5 is
now *technically* unblocked (it needs a measured `resnet50` teacher, which
exists). Finish NB4 first: it is minutes, and Q3/Q4 tell you whether the
per-sample tables are sound before you spend days distilling from them.

NB5 also **trains 18 new runs** (3 students × 3 seeds × 2 arms). Two of those
architectures have never been timed at the corrected `channels_last` setting,
so the cost is unknown. Run `python tools/conv_sweep.py --arch deit_small`
first — 2 minutes — before committing days to it.

### Every time you re-run a notebook after I change something

1. **Close it in Jupyter WITHOUT saving.** Jupyter writes the open tab to disk
   when you run it, so a stale tab silently overwrites the regenerated file
   (D-68).
2. `python build_notebooks_in100.py`
3. Reopen · Kernel → Restart · Run All
4. Cell 1 must print `msc_lib build <hash> verified, and current with src/`.
   If it says `STALE NOTEBOOK`, step 1 did not happen.

---

## 5. Facts established by measurement (not estimate)

| finding | evidence |
|---|---|
| `channels_last` is **6.7× slower** on this card | `conv_sweep`: 81.6 → 550.3 img/s, RTX 4000 Ada / cuDNN 9.1. Default is now `False`. |
| The loader was **never** the bottleneck | `dataload_frac = 0.000` across all 4 runs |
| Augmentation is not the bottleneck | `augment_frac` 1.2% (resnet50), 9.4% (vit) |
| The GPU was busy, not starved | 108 W of 130 W, `gpu0_util` 98.5% |
| ViT-S/16 is 7.5× faster than ResNet-50 here | 106 vs 796 ms/batch, same loader |
| Disk is fast | RAM cache reads 23.7 GiB at 1.5–3.4 GiB/s |

**Stale numbers.** Every throughput figure for `vgg16`, `resnet18`,
`shufflenetv2_in`, `swin_tiny`, `convnext_tiny` was taken under the slow layout
and is understated by an unknown factor (`IN100_PENDING_REMEASURE`). Any atlas
budget built on them is wrong in the pessimistic direction.

---

## 6. Open scientific questions — read before writing the paper

1. **Only 2 seeds per architecture.** ρ_seed from a single pair is a point
   estimate with no error bar, on the quantity every transfer claim divides by.
   The plan called for 3.
2. **ViT overfits hard**: train 98.7% vs val 60.6% — a 38-point gap, against
   16 points for ResNet-50. That is the no-strong-augmentation arm behaving as
   designed (`DEIT_RECIPE` covers `deit_small` only), but a badly-overfit ViT
   may not be the right input to a seed-reliability comparison. Decide this
   deliberately, and write down which way and why.
3. **Equal epochs for all architectures** is a confound the user chose
   knowingly. It must be stated in the paper, not discovered by a reviewer.
4. **The pilot is 2 architectures.** No CNN/attention conclusion can rest on
   `resnet50` vs `vit_small_p16` alone.

## 7. Defects, most recent first

Full analysis in `22_IN100_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md`. Fixed unless marked.

| # | one line | cost |
|---|---|---|
| D-71 | `require` matched a run id against an arch-keyed dict → Q3/Q4 silently empty | `KeyError: 'passed'` |
| D-70 | `np.asarray(y)` on a CUDA tensor — CIFAR yields CPU labels, IN-100 device labels | failed 40 min into the sweep |
| D-69 | checkpoint path joined to the run root; correct spelling was in dead HF code | 4 failed measurements |
| D-68 | Jupyter saved a stale notebook over the regenerated one | ~2 rounds |
| D-67 | `run_all(fn=sess.oracle)` planned as `stage='train'` → skipped everything, reported success | NB3 did nothing, twice |
| D-66 | `analyse_*_all` defaulted to `phase="p1"` internally | misleading `KeyError` in NB4 |
| D-65 | NB3/4/5 hardcoded `PHASE='p1'` while NB2 writes `p0` | silent no-op |
| D-64 | `final.csv` required at train stage, written at measure stage | false alarm on 4 healthy runs |
| D-63 | `hash_compatible` probed a reconstruction, not the on-disk record | 3 rounds |
| D-62 | stale module: fix on disk, old code running | 2 rounds |
| D-61 | `.get(k, nan)` does not fire on a present `None` | crash after training succeeded |
| D-60 | adding to `_HASH_EXCLUDE` changed every hash → orphaned checkpoints | nearly lost 90 GPU-h |
| D-59 | `channels_last` 6.7× **slower**; D-55 had enforced it | ~35 h × 2 runs |
| D-58 | measured it: convolutions, not the pipeline | — |
| D-57 | two wrong diagnoses from aggregate numbers | ~2 days |
| D-56 | RAM-resident loader (real fix, wrong premise) | — |
| D-55 | memory format applied at 1 of 16 sites (wrong direction) | — |
| D-54 | `run_all` handed a callable it cannot call | — |

**Recurring shapes, in order of how much they have cost:**

- *A test that agrees with the author instead of the program* — D-37, D-60, D-63
- *A path spelled twice, one spelling wrong* — D-16, D-23, D-69
- *A predicate answering a different question than the work* — D-31, D-67
- *A checker that fires on healthy code* — D-61, D-69, and this file's own §5
- *Silence as a failure mode* — D-65, D-67 (the expensive ones: no traceback)

---

## 8. Next actions

1. **Finish NB4** (close without saving → rebuild → reopen → Run All). Q1 and
   Q2 already produced results; D-71 unblocks Q3 and Q4.
2. ~~`exit_metrics.csv` is 0 bytes~~ — **false alarm, my error.** It is 269
   bytes and correct (exit, depth_fraction, rho, flops, stage_cut,
   feature_dim × 5 exits). My status check rounded 269 B to "0K".
3. Decide §6.1 (2 seeds vs 3) and §6.2 (the ViT overfitting arm) **before**
   NB5 — both change what NB5 is worth doing.
4. `conv_sweep --arch deit_small` before committing to NB5's 18 runs.
5. Then either NB5 (method) or start the `p1` atlas (the actual study).
