# Minimum Sufficient Compute (MSC)

**How much compute does *this* sample actually need, and is that a property of
the sample or of the seed?**

MSC is a per-sample, cost-normalised, multi-axis, stability-closed measure of
the compute a trained network needs to reach its final decision. Two studies
live in this repository:

| study | dataset | scale | architectures | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Study 1 · CIFAR-100** | 50k @ 32px | small | 15 | complete — [`docs/cifar100/10_FINAL_RESULTS.md`](docs/cifar100/10_FINAL_RESULTS.md) |
| **Study 1 · ImageNet-100** | 130k @ 224px | 40× data, 49× pixels | 2 (pilot) + 3 students | pilot complete — [`docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md`](docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md) |
| **Study 2** | both, re-analysed | — | 15 + 2 | **proposal** — [`study2/README.md`](study2/README.md) |

**Study 2 is a design, not a result.** It reuses Study 1's 49 measured runs to
ask a question that does not depend on MSC being a good metric, and it is built
so the cheap measurements gate the expensive ones. Start at
[`study2/README.md`](study2/README.md); the decisions it needs are in
[`study2/05_OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](study2/05_OPEN_DECISIONS.md).

## Start here

**If you want the science** — what was predicted, what was measured, and what
is actually new — read
[`docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md`](docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md).
It scores all five pre-registered hypotheses against **both** studies.

**If you want the current operational state**, read
[`docs/imagenet100/24_IN100_STATUS.md`](docs/imagenet100/24_IN100_STATUS.md).

**If something is broken**, read
[`docs/imagenet100/23_IN100_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/imagenet100/23_IN100_RUNBOOK.md)
— a symptom → cause → fix table.

**If you are picking this project up**, read in this order:

1. [`docs/cifar100/09_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md`](docs/cifar100/09_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md) —
   36 defects, each with a contamination analysis. The most important file.
2. [`docs/cifar100/10_FINAL_RESULTS.md`](docs/cifar100/10_FINAL_RESULTS.md)
3. [`docs/cifar100/07_REPLICATION_PLAYBOOK.md`](docs/cifar100/07_REPLICATION_PLAYBOOK.md)
4. [`docs/cifar100/00_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/cifar100/00_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md)
5. [`docs/imagenet100/22_IN100_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md`](docs/imagenet100/22_IN100_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md)
   — defects D-37…D-85 from the ImageNet port.

**The notebooks are generated.** Editing one does nothing that survives a
rebuild — edit `src/msc_lib.py` or the generator, then:

```bash
python build_notebooks_in100.py
```

The build refuses to emit if any of these fail: undefined names, cells that do
not parse as Python 3.10, unknown column names, literal repo paths, wrong call
arity, or a stage predicate that would skip the work it was asked to do.

## Verifying a checkout

```bash
python src/msc_lib.py --selftest      # 454 checks, each with a canary
python tools/check_names.py           # no NameErrors waiting in a branch
python tools/check_links.py           # every doc reference resolves
python build_notebooks_in100.py       # regenerate + all six validation layers
```

The self-test is designed to be able to fail: it carries a deliberate canary
that must report `FAIL`, and a floor on the number of checks. A suite that
cannot fail is [D-37](docs/imagenet100/22_IN100_LAB_NOTEBOOK.md).

## Running the ImageNet-100 pipeline

```
NB1_Setup  →  NB2_Train  →  NB3_Measure  →  NB4_Analysis  →  NB5_Method  →  NB6_Publish
```

Full instructions, including the close-without-saving step that Jupyter makes
necessary, are in
[`docs/imagenet100/24_IN100_STATUS.md`](docs/imagenet100/24_IN100_STATUS.md) §4.

Requirements: `requirements.txt`. Runs fully offline; nothing is downloaded at
run time. Artifacts stay on local disk and are pushed to HuggingFace only by
`NB6_Publish`.

## Results in one paragraph

> MSC is a reliable, three-dimensional, largely architecture-transferable
> per-sample quantity — and it does **not** yield better inference routing than
> confidence thresholding, because the oracle ceiling for MSC-based routing is
> itself flat.

Compute-need is three-dimensional in both studies (PC1 max 0.532 on CIFAR,
0.547 on ImageNet, against a pre-registered 0.60 — refuted twice). It transfers
across the convolution/attention boundary above the pre-registered bound in
both (T = 0.710 and 0.640 against a predicted < 0.6, with a shuffled control at
0.037). Seed-reliability is architecture-dependent in both, same ordering, on
non-overlapping architectures — which is what makes noise-ceiling correction a
demonstrated necessity rather than an argued one.

**The new result is the oracle ceiling.** The CIFAR study lists B11 as its
*"one substantive gap remaining"* (O-21) — without it, "did the method fail or
is the premise empty?" is unanswerable. It is now computed for 18 students:
B11 is **+0.00007** over confidence routing, so there was never headroom, and
MSC-KD's −0.0088 is a fact about the premise rather than the distillation.

Scorecard, caveats and cost of closing the gaps:
[`docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md`](docs/imagenet100/26_IN100_FINDINGS.md).
