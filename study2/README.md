# Study 2 — complete

**Run, verified, and written up.** The result is in
[`PAPER.md`](PAPER.md); every number traces to a CSV in `analysis/`.

Study 1 (`docs/cifar100/`, `docs/imagenet100/`) stays as it is and is cited.

## The result in one line

> **Oracle upper bounds for early-exit routing are inflated by +22.41 accuracy
> points — more than the entire headroom they appear to show — and the excess is
> per-exit noise that does not survive a change of training seed.**

Across 15 CIFAR-100 architectures × 3 seeds (90 ordered seed pairs), at ρ = 0.80:

| | median |
|---|---|
| confidence baseline (deployable) | 62.39 % |
| full compute, final exit | 71.21 % |
| oracle scored from the **same** seed it routes | **78.30 %** (+12.20 pt) |
| oracle scored from a **different** seed | **54.50 %** (−7.90 pt) |
| **optimism bias** | **+22.41 pt** |

**0 of 15** architectures retain positive honest headroom, at any budget from
ρ = 0.40 to 0.95.

### The core claim, and what it rests on

The bias splits into two parts that are **not** equally well evidenced:

| | median | share | strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** in-seed oracle above the network's **own full accuracy** | **+6.86 pt** | 31 % | **exact identity, unarguable** |
| **B** cross-seed oracle below full accuracy | +15.33 pt | 69 % | weaker — see below |

**A is the result.** `oracle_in − acc_full == frac_early_saves` to numerical
precision on all 90 rows: at ρ = 0.80 the budget never binds, so the in-seed
oracle is just *P(correct at any exit)*. The published-style bound therefore sits
**6.86 points above the accuracy you get by simply running the whole network** —
unreachable by any router, because the excess is entirely samples the net gets
right early and **wrong at the end**. It needs no second seed to establish.

**B is weaker and we say so.** It conflates "the signal does not transfer" with
"acting on a non-transferring signal is worse than not acting". An earlier draft
folded both into one +22.41 pt headline and attributed it all to noise
harvesting; checking showed the bias does **not** correlate with the noise pool
across architectures (ρ = +0.011), so the claim was decomposed instead.

### Hypotheses as pre-registered

| | | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | ρ_seed varies by ≥ 0.15 | **SUPPORTED** — range 0.667 |
| **H3** | in-seed oracle optimistic by ≥ 0.5 pt | **SUPPORTED for the true oracle** (+22.41 pt); **not supported** for per-sample difficulty scores |
| **H4** | corr(unreliability, bias) ≥ 0.5 | **NOT SUPPORTED** — ρ = +0.346, p = 0.002, right sign, below threshold |
| **H5** | nothing clears +1.0 pt honest headroom | **SUPPORTED** — every score negative at every budget |

**This confirms Study 1 rather than overturning it.** B11 measured +0.00007 and
was read as a possible MSC artifact. It was not — the debiased headroom is
negative across five scores and seven budgets, and Study 2 supplies the reason.

## Secondary findings

- **The four softmax scores are one score.** ρ = 0.997–1.000 between `msp`,
  `margin`, `entropy`, `ce_loss`. Eight candidates are **three families**; the
  grid's effective n is 3 × 15, not 8 × 15.
- **Difficulty scores collapse on memorised training data.** ce_loss ρ_seed
  falls 0.647 → **0.108** (`mixer_nano`), 0.673 → **0.116** (`vit_tiny`) between
  the test split and `train_holdout` — which is a slice *of* train. Low-capacity
  nets barely move (`mobilenetv2` 0.874 → 0.849). `forget_events` stays at 0.852.
  Dataset pruning computes exactly these scores, on exactly this data, from one
  seed. **Mechanism confirmed:** the drop is predicted by softmax saturation
  (ρ = **+0.832**) and train accuracy (**+0.746**), but **not** by test accuracy
  (**−0.114**) — so it is not "weaker models are noisier". It is independent of
  the oracle result (bias vs saturation: −0.214).

## What it cost

**No GPU beyond re-measuring FLOP budgets. No training. No new runs.** Every
per-sample parquet already carried per-exit predictions, so the whole study is
CPU re-analysis of files Study 1 had already published.

## The rule this study is built around

> **Measure the ceiling before building the method.**

Study 1 spent 79 GPU-hours training 18 MSC-KD students to close a gap that a
two-hour oracle measurement showed did not exist. The ceiling was computed
*after* the method, and only because the method's failure forced the question.

In Study 2, every claim of the form "signal X could improve Y" is preceded by
"what is the best X could possibly do", and that measurement is a gate: if the
ceiling is flat, the method is not built.

## What actually went wrong

Kept here because the postmortem is the point of this folder.

**The measurement was implemented wrong three times**, each time producing a
plausible number that had to be attacked rather than believed:

1. **+5.165 pt** — the "oracle" was `pred_depth` and the baseline thresholded
   the *final* exit's confidence. Both need a full forward pass, so it compared
   two oracles.
2. **−10 pt** — the baseline was fixed, but it could choose any exit histogram
   while difficulty scores were forced through a rigid quantile spread. That
   measured the mechanism, not the signal.
3. **−8 pt** — histograms matched, but a per-*sample* score was being compared
   against a per-*exit* baseline. The baseline knew "am I right at exit k"; the
   score only knew "is this sample hard". Better-informed side won.

The fourth implementation is a from-scratch Lagrangian maximum over every
assignment meeting the budget, which dominates any router by construction. It
passes 18 canaries including *identical seeds → bias exactly 0.0000* and
*independent seeds → +46.4 pt*.

**Two contamination bugs were found by checking artifacts rather than plans:**
`p0`/`p1` pilot pairs were the *same seed* run twice (49 → 45 runs, 118 → 90
pairs), and P0a's correlation matrix was computed on a run that deduplication
had already dropped.

**A statistic reported a conclusion from zero samples.** P0a printed `(n=0)`, an
all-NaN matrix, and "the scores carry distinct information", because a listwise
NaN mask dropped every row. Every statistic now carries a canary proving it can
report a wrong answer.

**The lesson that generalises:** the study's headline is "headroom ≈ 0", and a
broken instrument reports ≈ 0 too. The canary that mattered most builds a world
where headroom certainly exists and requires the measurement to find it
(+49.3 pt). Without it, three of the four wrong implementations above would have
produced a publishable-looking null.
