# S3_NB0 — does exit quality predict the oracle excess?

**~15 minutes · CPU only · no training · reads data already on disk**

## Why this runs first

Study 2's core claim is that the oracle early-exit bound sits **+6.86 points
above the network's own full-compute accuracy**, and that the excess is
per-exit noise. Study 1 trained its exit heads on a **frozen** backbone;
MSDNet, BranchyNet and DE3-BERT train exits **jointly**. Better exits might
shrink the excess to nothing, which would make Study 2 an artifact.

Settling that costs ~10 GPU-hours (`S3_NB1`). **This notebook tries to
pre-answer it for free.**

Across Study 1's 15 architectures, exit-head quality already varies a great
deal. If the excess **shrinks as the early exits get stronger**, joint training
would shrink it further and we can estimate by how much. If the excess is
**insensitive** to exit quality, joint training is unlikely to remove it.

> **This is a gate, not evidence.** It is observational and
> cross-architectural: architectures differ in many ways besides exit quality.
> It cannot replace `S3_NB1`. It only tells us how much `S3_NB1` is worth, and
> what to expect — which makes the GPU result falsifiable in advance instead of
> merely interesting.

## The quantities

For every measured run, from `per_sample/test.parquet`:

|---|---|
| `acc_full` | accuracy of the final exit — what you get by running everything |

| **`excess`** | `P(correct at ANY exit) − acc_full` — Study 2's +6.86 pt |
| **`exit_quality`** | mean of `acc_k / acc_full` over the early exits |

`exit_quality` near 1.0 means the early exits are nearly as good as the full

should sit closer to it. The regression of `excess` on `exit_quality` is the
extrapolation.

# S3_NB1 — joint exit training

**~10 GPU-hours · 3 runs · fully resumable · the blocking experiment**

## What this settles

Study 1 trained exit heads on a **frozen** backbone. The field trains them
**jointly**. If Study 2's +6.86 pt excess is an artifact of weak post-hoc
exits, it should shrink or vanish here.

**Pre-registered (`study3/01_PROTOCOL.md` H1):**

```
oracle_in − acc_full  ≥  2.0 accuracy points,  in 3 of 3 architectures
```

| measured | verdict |
|---|---|
| ≥ 2.0 pt in 3/3 | Study 2 is **not** a frozen-backbone artifact — archival paper unblocked |
| 0.5 – 2.0 pt | real but much smaller; the paper leads with the joint number |
| < 0.5 pt | Study 2 **is** an artifact — withdraw to a methodological note, Q3 becomes the main paper |

## Why this needs no seeds

The quantity is a **per-run identity**:
`oracle_in − acc_full == frac_early_saves`. It is computed from one network's
own per-exit predictions. Seeds were needed for the *bias*, not for this. So
this is **{len(Q1_ARCHS)} architectures × 1 seed**, not × 3 — roughly 10
GPU-hours instead of 30.

## The design is paired

Everything is held constant against the Study 1 runs of the same architectures.
**One variable changes:** `joint_exits`. Same data, same epochs, same optimiser,
same augmentation, same exit positions, same FLOP budgets, and — most
importantly — the **same measurement code**.

# S3_NB3 — how much of the gap can a learned router capture?

**~5 GPU-hours · feature dump + a small gate per exit**

## The overclaim this fixes

Study 2 says the oracle excess "cannot be reached by any router". What was
actually shown is that **a second seed** cannot reach it. A learned router with
access to the input might do better, and nobody has measured it.

```
capture fraction = (router − confidence baseline) / (oracle_in − baseline)
```

**Pre-registered (H2):** a learned router captures **< 25 %** of the gap.

| outcome | reading |
|---|---|
| captures most | the field is right, the gap is real headroom, and here is a router |
| captures a little | the bound is mostly noise, now quantified |
| captures none | the strongest version of Study 2's claim |

All three are reportable and two are positive.

## The deployability constraint

A gate at exit *k* may use **only features available at exit k**. Anything else
is not a router, it is an oracle wearing a router's clothes — the exact mistake
`pred_depth` turned out to be in Study 2.

## The control that decides whether the number means anything

Train the gate on seed *i*, evaluate on seed *j*'s network. An in-seed capture
fraction alone is uninterpretable: a gate can fit one seed's noise perfectly.
**Both numbers are reported, always.**

## What features can a gate actually see?

**Checked against the disk, not assumed.** `S2_NB0_Fetch` deliberately excluded
checkpoints -- they are ~95 % of the bytes and nothing had needed them -- so the
45 Study 1 runs have per-sample parquets and **no weights**. Only runs trained
locally have `ckpt_best.pt`.

That rules out an embedding gate for the multi-seed architectures, and saying so
is better than working around it:

| gate features | needs | runs available | cross-seed control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **exit-local confidence** (`top1p_dk`, `top2p_dk`, margin) | parquet only | **all 45** | **yes, 3 seeds** |
| pooled embeddings at exit *k* | `ckpt_best.pt` | 3 joint runs, 1 seed each | no |

So Q2 uses **exit-local confidence features** -- which is what is available and,
usefully, exactly what a deployed early-exit gate reads. The baseline thresholds
`top1p_dk`; the gate sees the same information plus the margin, and learns a
**per-exit** boundary instead of one global threshold.

**This makes H2 a lower bound**, and the notebook says so in its output. A gate
with embeddings might capture more; measuring that needs checkpoints we chose
not to download. A limitation, recorded rather than hidden.

# S3_NB4 — does the memorisation collapse damage pruning?

**~18 GPU-hours · 14 runs · fully resumable · independent of Q1 and Q2**

## The claim being tested

Study 2 §4.3: softmax difficulty scores lose seed reliability on data the model
has **memorised** — `ce_loss` ρ_seed falls 0.647 → 0.108 — predicted by
saturation (ρ = +0.832) and **not** by test accuracy (−0.114).

Dataset pruning computes exactly these scores, on exactly this data, from a
single seed. **A warning is not a demonstration.** This measures the damage.

| source | train acc | > 0.99 conf | ρ_seed drop |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{SATURATED}` (saturated) | 99.99 % | 71 % | 0.558 |
| `{UNSATURATED}` (unsaturated) | 83.1 % | 16 % | 0.026 |

**Pre-registered (H3):** the saturated source is worse by **≥ 1.0 pt** at 30 %
retention, and the gap widens as retention falls.
**H3b:** the saturated source is indistinguishable from **random** pruning
(±0.5 pt) at 30 %. If true, that is the headline.

## Scope: this prunes a 5,000-sample pool, not the full training set

**Checked, not assumed.** `ce_loss` -- the score whose reliability collapses --
is written only to `train_holdout.parquet`, which is a **5,000-sample** slice of
train. `train_dynamics.parquet` covers more samples but carries only `el2n` and
`forget_events`, which are the *stable* scores and therefore cannot test this
hypothesis.

So the experiment is: **one fixed 5,000-sample pool, three selection rules, same
target, same seeds.** That is a real controlled comparison and it does test H3 --
but it is a smaller claim than "pruning CIFAR-100", and the notebook says so.

Scaling to the full 50,000 would need `ce_loss` recomputed over all of train,
which needs the source models' checkpoints. Those were deliberately excluded
from the HuggingFace fetch, so it is a separate ~2 GPU-h job, not a free one.

## The cheap gate runs first

If the two sources keep nearly the same samples, no downstream difference is
possible and 18 GPU-hours buy nothing. That check costs minutes.
